## Usage

### Quick Setup (Browser Console)

// Import and run in browser console
import { setupDemoEventTeams } from '@/lib/teamUtils';
setupDemoEventTeams();
```

### Programmatic Setup
```typescript
import { setupDemoEventTeams, clearDemoEventTeams } from '@/lib/teamUtils';
import { createAllTestData } from '@/lib/testDataGenerator';

// Set up just event teams
setupDemoEventTeams();

// Or set up all demo data
await createAllTestData();

// Clear event teams
clearDemoEventTeams();
```

### Available Demo Events

After running `setupDemoEventTeams()`, you'll have access to these demo events:

1. **2024dcmp** - FIRST Championship - Washington
   - Source: TBA
   - Teams: All 60 teams from match schedule
   
2. **2024mdbet** - Bethesda Robotics Invitational

## Pit Assignments Page Testing

1. Run the demo setup
2. Navigate to the Pit Assignments page
3. You should see the demo events available in the dropdown
4. Add some scouters in the management section
5. Try different assignment modes:
   - **Sequential**: Assigns teams in order
   - **Spatial**: Uses pit addresses (for Nexus events) 
   - **Manual**: Click to assign individual teams

## Integration with Other Pages

The teams data is designed to work with:

- **Team Statistics Page**: Shows stats for demo teams
- **Strategy Pages**: Uses team lists for analysis
- **Pick List Page**: Uses teams for pick list generation
- **Match Strategy**: References teams in match planning

## Data Persistence

Demo data is stored in localStorage with these keys:
- `tba_event_teams_*` - TBA-style team data
- `nexus_event_teams_*` - Nexus-style team data  
- `nexus_pit_addresses_*` - Pit address mappings for Nexus events

## Cleaning Up

To remove demo data:
```typescript
import { clearDemoEventTeams } from '@/lib/teamUtils';
clearDemoEventTeams();
```

Or clear everything:
```typescript
import { clearAllTestData } from '@/lib/testDataGenerator';
await clearAllTestData();
```
